    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hi there! <br />
      I'm Kurisutinay and I recently started learning web development. I am enjoying learning it so far</p>
      <p>I am currently in an administrative services industry and wanted to shift to developing. <br />
        You'll be able to see all projects I have done in this site.</p>
        <p>I have a cat named Guilliane (Juju) and she's a Himalayan. You may see her a lot in this project as I have nothing much going on in my life aside from online games and reading.</p>
        <h4>Online Games I play:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/">Valorant</a></li>
